# Task A
Build a classification model using Python and a popular machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Evaluate the model's performance on a given dataset and provide insights on its accuracy and metrics.

## My Approach
I decided to build Crop Recommendation System from a database of N P K values, I've used the RandomForestClassifier model from scikit-learn library with 100 Decision Tree limit.<br>

### Evalution Metrics
`Accuracy`: ~61.5%<br>
`Recall`: ~62.5%<br>
`F1 score`: ~62%<br>
